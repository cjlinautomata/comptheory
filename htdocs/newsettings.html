    <h1>New settings this year</h1>

    <p> We used blackboard before but change to use slides in this semester. The reason is not
      because slides are better. It is because I can no longer stand and write things for three hours

    <p> Therefore, although our slides are based on my past notes, in a sense they are newly developed. Some error may exist and room for improvements is definitely possible. We decide to make Latex sources of all slides publicly available at github; see the address <a href=https://github.com/cjlinautomata>here</a>. You are welcome to file a pull request for improving our slides. For example, if you think one figure that I drew is ugly, you can create a more beautiful one.

    <p>Further, we will pre-record all lectures and broadcast them in the class. Some reasons for doing so.
      <ul>
	<li>
	  If an online mode is needed due to new COVID-19 outbreaks, we are fully ready
	<li>
	  It is difficult for me to continuously talk for three hours. The teaching quality may significantly deteriate at some point as I get tired.
      </ul>
      By our design, each video clip will cover no more than 15 slides. Thus if slides are updated, a new lecture can be recorded. In the class I will give additional comments while the video is being played.

      <p> With these new settings, further adjustments are possible. We like to do new experiments and are willing to try some creative ways to improve this course.
