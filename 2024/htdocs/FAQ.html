<b>Q: How do I enroll the course?</b>

<p>
  You can directly do it through the school's system. No need to
  get an enrollment code from us

<hr>
<b>Q: How do I submit my homework?</b>

<p>
Submit to NTU COOL.
If you write your homework by hand, please scan
them or take photos, and the submission should be a <b>PDF</b> file.
Please make sure your writing can be recognized
by the TAs, otherwise you may get zero points.

<hr>
<b>Q: What if I do not submit my homework in time?</b>

<p>
You will get zero points, so please submit your homeworks before the deadline.

<!--
<hr>
<b>Q: How do I register on Gradescope?</b>

<p>
TAs will invite you via your ntu email
and please use your student ID as your account.
If you do not recieve the invited email, 
please contact TAs as soon as possible.
-->

<hr>
<b>Q: I always type my homework. Will I get
better HW scores?</b>

<p>
No. As long as you write things clearly by hand,
you should get the same scores.

<!--
<hr>
<b>Q: Will the HW solutions be provided?</b>

<p>
Yes, after the HW is submitted or graded.

<hr>
<b>Q: I take the Tu class, may I submit my HW
on a TH deadline?</b>

<p>
No. If we find that out, you will get a serious
penalty.

<hr>
<b>Q: Then why not just having one HW deadline for
both classes?</b>

<p>
Maybe you come to school only on Tu or Th.
Hence the same deadline may not be convenient
for some of you.
If you have a better solution, please let me know.

<hr>
<b>Q: Since people in class A has an earlier
deadline, will people in class B just copy their
work?</b>

<p>
Well, this happens regardless of whether you
guys are in the same class or not.
We used to have HW every week. But I find
that some just copy others' work. So I decide
to have three exams and have less homework.

-->

<!-- <hr>
<b>Q: The teacher bring HWs to the class and return
them to students. What if I don't come to get them?
</b>

<p>
We will leave your HWs in the classroom. They
may be thrown away by some people. -->



<hr>
<b>Q: What if I find an error in slides?</b>

<p>
Latex sources of all slides are publicly available at github; see the
address <a href=https://github.com/cjlinautomata>here</a>. You are
welcome to file a pull request for improving our slides. For example,
if you think one figure that I drew is ugly, you can create a more
beautiful one.

<hr>
<b>Q: What's the formula to calculate your grade?</b>

<p>
Depending on your performance, we decide the
distribution of your grades. That is, how
many get A+ and how many get F-.
Then, we calculate raw scores, obtain a ranking of
students, and assign their grades. 

<p>
So there is no direct relationship between your raw
score and your grade. It is possible that
your raw score is 99, but you get F-.


<hr>
<b>Q: This course is taught in English. What if I write my homework/exam answers in Chinese?</b>

<p>
You don't get any credit.


<hr>
<b>Q: May I use pencil for writing my exam answers?</b>

<p>
Yes.

<hr>
<b>Q: May I use the 1st/2nd editions of the textbook?</b>

<p>
Yes. But you are responsible to find HW questions
and get any new materials covered in the 
edition we are using.

<!--
<hr>
<b>Q: Why we have exams in the evening?</b>

<p>
In short, to have a fair evaluation.
We may consider some alternatives, but they
also have drawbacks (e.g., we can 
give two sets of exam questions and
then adjust average scores of two classes).
Sorry I don't see a perfect setting.
-->

<hr>
<b>Q: Who will grade my HW?</b>

<p>
TAs.

<hr>
<b>Q: If I have questions about the grading of my HW, whom should
I contact?</b>

<p>
TAs.

<hr>
<b>Q: Who will grade exams?</b>

<p>
I will do it.

<hr>
<b>Q: What if I do not attend the exams?</b>

<p>
You will not pass the course (i.e., get F for the score) if you miss an exam.

<hr>
<b>Q: Will materials before the previous exam be covered for the
current one?</b>

<p>
No, only materials after the previous exam are considered.

<hr>
<b>Q: For one exam question, you are asked to give a proof. Will I get partial credits
if I don't finish the whole proof.</b>

<p>
It depends. But in general <b>not</b>.
A proof is a proof. Otherwise everybody
can claim that he/she proves NP = P
(or NP != P).
You will learn this NP=P issue in this
course, which may be the greatest 
unsolved computer science problem.

<hr>
<b>Q: May I bring the textbook to the exam?</b>

<p>
Yes, but ONLY textbook and notes. You cannot bring any other books and digital devices.

<hr>
<b>Q: With the above FAQ, the teacher still gets 10 mails asking what can/cannot bring in the exam. What will he think?</b>

<p>
One or two are ok. But 10 will make him feel sad. 
Please try to check FAQ or the course web page before
sending me a mail. Everyday I have too many mails.

<hr>
<b>Q: When will we discuss exam questions?</b>

<p>
The week after the midterm exam (during 
the regular lecture time). 

<p> For the final exam, the discussion
time will be posted on the course web page.


  <hr>
<b>Q: How to ask questions about the grading of my exam?</b>
  
<p>
  We will run an online session for this.
  Through the provided links, those having questions will be
  queued in a waiting room. Then sequentially each one is admitted,
  shares the screen to show your answer, and discusses issues with me.
  
<!--
<hr>
<b>Q: Even with the above FAQ, 20 students don't come to get their answer sheets. Moreover, 10 complain (email, bbs, or ...) that they don't know when the discussion sessions are. What will the teacher think?</b>

<p>
Well, he won't be very happy
-->

<hr>
<b>Q: In the lecture, the teacher mentions something
not in the textbook. The same materials appear in the exam. Some argue that they missed the lecture as they were sick. Hence they hope to get credits of that exam question. What will the teacher think?</b>

<p>Well, shouldn't you borrow lecture notes from someone? 

<hr>
<b>Q: My final grade is D+. May the teacher kindly change it to C-?</b>

<p>
No. I have never done that.

<p> Sending me a mail is useless, so don't waste your time.
<!--

<hr>
<b>Q: But being flunked by many courses,
I am going to be kicked out of the school. May the teacher please do me a favor?</b>

<p>
No, I am very sorry.

<hr>
<b>Q: Even with the above faq, I still keep 
bugging the teacher. What will he do?</b>

<p>
Well, your 59 may become 50, 40, or even lower.
-->

<!--

<hr>
<b>Q: The teacher goes through this FAQ in the 1st lecture. But in the end of the semester some complain that they never know the existence of this FAQ. What will the teacher think?</b>

<p>
Is this really an faq?
